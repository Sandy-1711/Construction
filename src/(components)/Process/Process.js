                            It is the most important step in building construction. Search for the location of the building which is best suited for building construction purposes. It is highly recommended to take legal opinion before purchase of land. If you are searching land for commercial purpose, it&apos;s highly recommended to consult Architect, who has knowledge of local Municipal Laws.

                            After selecting the proper land for the building, take the help of a professional architect to create building designs and take his advice.
                            An architect prepares a plan as per building requirements based on your requirements and budget. Then the architect consults a structural consultant for details of the RCC be used, depth of foundation, dimensions of beams and columns, steel enforcement of slab, etc.

                        <p>Building construction involves a huge amount of material and budget. After, planning and structural detailing have been completed these details are transferred to the cost estimator.
                            The building estimator will estimate the material quantity, and quantity of different items of work, and prepare an abstract sheet that shows the cost of building construction.
                            If financial resources are limited, we need to seek pre-approval for loans in advance.

                        <p>A builder or civil contractor for construction must be chosen carefully because it is a major factor in securing building construction quality and timely construction of work. Pre-investigation must be done about the builder before handing in work. In the work agreement, the work-related details must be clearly stated. The contract document should cover layout and work details along with the payment methods, time scales, and costs. The condition of the agreement should be thoroughly checked before signing a final deal.

                        <p>The foundation of the building ground is excavated with the help of excavating machines as per the building dimension specified in the drawings. In this foundation trench, a layer of PCC (Plain cement concrete) is laid in the dug portion before placing the reinforcements for the foundation. This is most neglected part but yet the most important one. The PCC layer is base of entire foundation and hence proper care must be taken to give it good strength. </p>

A building is a load transferred from the superstructure to the soil and needs to be extremely strong to handle the load. After the PCC work foundation reinforcement work is started. The foundation&apos;s bottom level must check before concreting it. The remaining space between the foundation is filled with earth.</p>

                        <p>As the column and beam framework is completed masonry work is started with different materials such as bricks, concrete blocks, fly ash bricks, etc. according to the building drawing. Masonry work is done using a cement mortar mix. It is a mixture of cement & sand. During this carefully and as per drawing gaps are laid for doors and windows during the masonry work.</p>

                        <p>As we know buildings are constructed with a clean finish in which electrical and plumbing work is not visible. They are installed in the walls and slabs such that they are concealed and not visible after the finishing work is done.The point and pipe ends are left out such that later they can be finished with the electric fitting and plumbing fixtures. </p>
