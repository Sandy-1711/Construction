                        <h2>1. What exactly does Evana Infratech do?</h2>
                        <p>Evana Infratech is basically a stop solution for all your construction-related needs. For example, say you have purchased land and now you want to construct any type of building over it like a House, bungalow, Hospital, mall, etc. Evana Infratech will construct every inch of your building and will hand over the key to you. </p>

                        <h2>2. Which types of material does Evana Incratech use?</h2>
                        <p>We have different packages based on material selection. We can use any material based on your choices and preferences. We give you a standard quotation, where we mention all the materials and brands. For example, steel of Tata, Cement of ACC, paint of Asian, etc. However, clients have the liberty to choose materials and brands of their choice. </p>

                        <h2>3. What will be the total cost of my building construction?</h2>
                        <p>The cost of any building can be precisely calculated only after analysis of drawings and the requirements of the client. However, on a very broad basis, the rate varies from Rs 1600 per square feet to Rs 2000 per Square feet. Rates can even be higher depending upon different permutations and combinations. Refer to the package session for more information. </p>

                        <h2>4. How cost of the building is calculated?</h2>
                        <p>The total cost of the building is calculated from the casted slab. For example, if the quoted rate is Rs 1700 per square feet and the total slab of the building is 1000 Square Feet then the final rate of the building shall be Rs 1700000 plus additional charges.</p>

                        <h2>5. What are additional/extra charges? </h2>
                        <p>Some parts of the buildings have variations depending upon multiple factors like soil conditions, types of facade, boundary walls, etc. In a crude sense, any structure of the building that is outside the slab of the building taken for calculation is taken under the head of additional cost. As of today, some items under extra costs are soil filing, mumty slab, landscaping, boundary wall with gate, any structure outside the slab, any materials used in the facade other than concrete, cement and paint. </p>

                        <p>We provide ready-to-shift buildings. In simple words, we hand over the building after complete finishing excluding the interior works. All scopes of work are clearly mentioned in the agreement/ quotation. We strongly recommend you to read the agreement properly to understand the scope of work.</p>

                        <p>For simple homes and bungalows, we provide all architectural drawings free of cost. However, for technical buildings like hospitals, malls, schools, etc, we take some additional charges as plans for these buildings require more teams of experts. </p>

                        <h2>10. Do I have to pay the full amount before the project starts?</h2>
                        <p>No. You will have to pay different amounts based on the personalised payment schedule based on the construction stages of your project. We charge a 2% booking amount during the signing of agreement. The next stage of 8% of the total amount is collected once the floor plan is finalised. Our construction company then moves forward with structural drawings(foundation, beam, slab, column, etc), MEP drawings, 3D elevation/facade, and the finaliazstion of project team.After the completion of the design phase, the finalised product is handed over to the project management team. This is where you need to pay 15% of the project value until the plinth is constructed. From here on, the remaining payment will be based on stages specific to the project. Refer to the agreement for more details.</p>

                        <p>It takes 10 to 16 months to complete a house construction project. However, it&apos;s not a thumb rule. The duration of project depends on multiple factors like space, built-up area, location, design, weather, soil condition, etc. </p>

                        <p>Carpet Area is the total usable area inside the house that can be covered by Carpet. The carpet area excludes the balcony and other utility areas but does include the area covered by internal walls.<br />Built-up Area is the sum of carpet area plus the area covered by the balcony, terrace, and other utility as well.<br />The Super built-up area is the total sum of the built-up area and space occupied by common areas like lobby, staircase, elevator, shafts, and clubhouse. This is often referred to as a saleable area.</p>

                        <p>No. Since types of boundary walls depend on house to house, it is a standard practice to put it under extra cost head. Some buildings even do not have boundary walls and some have only 2/3-sided walls. Hence, it&apoos;s always kept under additional head.</p>

                        <p>The pricing of our contracts is sealed on a stamp paper. Hence, the prices remain stable in most of the situations.
